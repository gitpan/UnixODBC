=head1 NAME

odbcbridge - Bridge proxy server daemon for UnixODBC.pm.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

odbcbridge

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Odbcbridge is a proxy server for ODBC clients that use the
UnixODBC::BridgeServer API.  In normal use, odbcbridge is started when
the system boots, and requires no user intervention.

Odbcbridge uses two configuration files, odbcbridge.conf and
odbclogins, for run-time configuration.  The configuration files are
described below.

Odbcbridge can be started manually from the shell prompt, or as
installed by the UnixODBC installation from the startup script
unixodbc:

  $ /usr/local/etc/init.d/unixodbc start

To terminate the operation of the daemon, use:

  $ /usr/local/etc/init.d/unixodbc stop

The unixodbc script is meant to start the daemon when the system boots
and terminate the daemon at system shut down.  To enable automatic
starting and stopping of the daemon, consult your system's
documentation.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 --help

Print help message and exit.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILES

=head2 odbcbridge.conf

Odbcbridge.conf is normally installed in /usr/local/etc and contains
configuration directives for odbcbridge, as well as host-based access.
Because UnixODBC::BridgeServers are a subclass of RPC::PlServer,
odbcbridge inherits all of its configuration facilities.  Consult the
RPC::PlServer man page for details about configuration.

Here is the odbcbridge.conf file that is installed during the 
odbcbridge installation:

  #
  # odbcbridge.conf - configuration options for UnixODBC.pm bridge 
  # server.
  # 

  {
	'localaddr' => undef,
	'localport' => 9999,
	'facility' => 'daemon',
	'user' => 'nobody',
	'group' => undef,
	'mode' => 'fork',
	# Increase this value if you receive socket reset errors
        'timeout' => 60,
	# Use syslog facility's daemon log.
	'logfile' => undef,
	'pidfile' => '/usr/local/var/odbcbridge/odbcbridge.pid',
	'debug' => 2,
	# Accept connections from anyone.	
	'clients' => [{
		'mask' => '.*',
		'accept' => 1}]
  }

=head2 odbclogins

The odbclogins file contains host login information, in the 
form:

  host::user::password

The odbclogins file should have permissions 0600, to prevent outside
users from viewing the information.  If using odbcbridge with 
CGI scripts, then the odbclogins ownership should be those named
in the Web server httpd.conf file's User and Group directives.

The odbclogins file that is installed with odbcbridge is shown here.

# odbclogins - each line has the format server::user::password
# IMPORTANT - make sure you chmod 0600 odbclogins, and, if using
# UnixODBC with CGI applications, change ownership to the user and 
# group of the httpd server - usually user nobody, group nobody, 
# although some installations use apache or www-data, or the values 
# of the User and Group directives in httpd.conf, if they are 
# something different.
# host1::user::password
# host2::user::password
# host3::user::password
