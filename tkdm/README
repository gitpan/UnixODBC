Installating and Configuring Tkdm
---------------------------------

Tkdm is installed as part of the UnixODBC.pm installation process.  If
for some reason you want to install it manually, you can copy the
program to a directory like /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin, as in this
example.

  # su
  # cp tkdm /usr/local/bin
  # chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/tkdm

Copy the dot-odbclogins file to $HOME/.odbclogins, and make sure that
the permissions are set so that other users can't view the login
information.

   $ cp dot-odbclogins $HOME/.odbclogins
   $ chmod 0600 $HOME/.odbclogins

There must be an entry for each host that has a UnixODBC bridge server
installed, with your login name and password for that system.  There
are sample entries in the dot-odbclogins file, and information about
the entry format in the tkdm manual page ("man tkdm").

For a description of how to use tkdm, refer to the manual page:
type "man tkdm."
