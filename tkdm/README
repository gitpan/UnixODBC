Tkdm Installation
-----------------

1. Make sure that UnixODBC is installed and the odbcbridge server is
   running correctly.

2. Make sure that Perl/Tk is installed correctly.

3. Create the $HOME/.odbclogins file, following the pattern of
    the Web datamanager's odbclogins file in the datamanager
    subdirectory.  (This will all have to be changed to MD5 or 
    some other form of authentican, soon.  Make sure that the 
    permissions of .odbclogins is set correctly (i.e., so that 
    it isn't world readable). 

4. Make sure that the path to the perl intererpeter on the first 
   line of the tkdm script is correct.  The path to the perl 
   interpreter is the   output of the command:   "which perl".  If 
   the script does not have the correct pathname of the perl 
   interpreter on your system, you will recieve errors like:

     $ bash: tkdm: command not found

   when you try to run the program.

5. Install the program and manual page:

     $ perl Makefile.PL
     $ make
     $ su
     # make install   

5. Print this text and save it as a Unix manual page: 

   pod2man <tkdm >tkdm.1
   su 
   cp tkdm.1 /usr/local/man/man1

For a description of how to use tkdm, refer to the manual page:
type "man tkdm."
