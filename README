- Overview

UnixODBC.pm provides Perl programs with a subset of the
X/Open ODBC Application Programming Interface implemented by
the unixODBC libraries from http://www.easysoft.com/.

UnixODBC.pm also provides a network bridge API that
implements ODBC function calls on networked host systems
using TCP/IP and Remote Procedure Calls, as well as simple
bridge client and server scripts.  Refer to the section,
"Installing and configuring the bridge server," below.

There are also sample text-mode clients (refer to the
section, "Client scripts"), and two Graphical User Interface
data manager applications that can perform ODBC queries on
networked systems: one that provides a Web Browser interface
and communicates with the UnixODBC bridge API using Apache
and CGI scripts and another, tkdm, that uses Perl/Tk.  Refer
to the sections, "Installing the GUI data manager, tkdm,"
and, "Installing the Web data manager," below, and the file,
"INSTALL" in the tkdm subdirectory.

Be sure also to consult dbms/README for information about
operating system and DBMS server compatibility and DBMS
server installation notes.


- Installing UnixODBC.pm

  UnixODBC.pm links against the unixODBC run time libraries,
  from http://www.easysoft.com, so they need to be installed 
  first.  This version of UnixODBC.pm works with version 2.2.0
  and later of the libraries.   UnixODBC.pm also requires the 
  unixODBC C-language include files from unixODBC to compile 
  UnixODBC.pm.  They should be installed in /usr/local/include 
  when you install unixODBC.  If they aren't, you can find them 
  in the include/ subdirectory of the unixODBC source code 
  package.
  
  To use the bridge server (to use ODBC to query DBMS servers on 
  networked systems), you'll need to have installed on each host 
  the same versions of Perl, Net::Daemon, PlRPC, and the modules 
  that they require. Tkdm requires Perl/Tk, but.  UnixODBC.pm 
  and the non-network text-mode programs work without the bridge 
  server.  

  This version of UnixODBC requires the following Perl libraries:

  - Net-Daemon-0.35 - 0.37
  - PlRPC-0.2015 - 0.2017
  - Tk800.021 - 0.23

  Versions of Perl prior to 5.6 might also need Sys::Syslog.pm and 
  Storable.pm.

  IMPORTANT - Each host system must use the same versions of ALL 
  the Perl software that UnixODBC uses - Perl, UnixODBC.pm,
  UnixODBC::BridgeServer.pm, Net-Daemon and PlRPC packages,
  Sys::Syslog.pm, and Storable.pm - on each networked system in
  order for the Bridge clients and servers to communicate with
  each other.

  To build and install the modules, use the following commands:

  $ cd UnixODBC-<version>
  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ su
  # make install

  If this is the first time installing UnixODBC.pm on the
  system, the installation gives the warning that UnixODBC.pm is 
  not installed.  If you receive warning messages that other 
  library modules are not installed, you should install them 
  before installing UnixODBC.

  To run the test script dbms/test.pl, you need to have 
  installed the data in the dbms subdirectory.  Refer to,
  "Testing UnixODBC.pm," below.  The ODBC driver needs to be 
  configured for your DBMS and a data source using either
  odbcinst or ODBCConfig.

  Standard Disclaimer - UnixODBC.pm and the client and server 
  scripts were written with Perl installed in /usr/local/bin.  
  If Perl scripts produce an error message like:

  sh: ./client: no such file or directory

  It means the script can't find the Perl interpreter.  Either
  change the path on the first line of the script to the location
  of the perl binary (the output of, "which perl"), or create a 
  symlink /usr/local/bin/perl to the actual perl program.


- Testing UnixODBC.pm

  UnixODBC.pm is known to work with MySQL and PostgreSQL on Linux
  and Solaris systems.

  Running, "make test," makes sure that the library modules load 
  correctly.  

  The dbms/test.pl script excercises the unixODBC API more thoroughly.  
  For the script to complete, it is necessary to have installed the 
  test data in the dbms/ subdirectory, and to have configured a DSN for 
  the test data.  Refer to the file dbms/README for notes about MySQL 
  and PostgreSQL DBMS's.

  Running test.pl is likely to result in at least a few errors.
  The script is designed to test the subset of ODBC API functions
  that UnixODBC.pm implements as exhaustively as possible, and as
  many different DBMS drivers as possible (currently the MyODBC and
  Easysoft PostgreSQL drivers).


- Installing and configuring the bridge server.

  IMPORTANT (Again) - The versions of Perl, Net::Daemon, Storable, and 
  PlRPC MUST be the same on all hosts.  Net::Daemon, in particular, 
  checks for version information when authenticating, and PlRPC will 
  generate protocol errors when communicating with different versions.
  Storable also relies having the same version of itself and Perl
  on local and remote systems.

  UnixODBC and the supporting libraries listed above are not
  thread-safe (yet), so you may encounter thread exceptions on some
  systems if Perl 5.8.0 has ithreads configured.

  Net::Daemon errors are commonly recorded in the syslog.
  Although you can configure the log messages, check the syslog
  first. Refer to the, "Troubleshooting," section, below.

  The bridge server runs as user nobody and uses port 9999.  To
  change the configuration, edit /usr/local/etc/odbcbridge.conf 
  after installation.  The RPC server settings are in the
  RPC::PlServer(3) man page.  Example server and client scripts
  are in the bridge/ directory.  For further examples of writing
  Perl RPC clients and servers, refer to the man pages for
  RPC::PlServer and RPC::PlClient, and the ProxyServer.pm module
  in the Perl DBI bundle.

  Install UnixODBC.pm.  If the installation proceeded 
  correctly, everything should be installed in the proper
  directories, and you should be able to start and stop
  the bridge server daemon by typing:

    # /usr/local/etc/init.d/unixodbc start
    # /usr/local/etc/init.d/unixodbc stop

  Manual Installation - Create the directories /usr/local/etc,
  /usr/local/var, and /usr/local/sbin if they don't exist 
  already, Then,

    $ su
    # mkdir /usr/local/var/odbcbridge
    # chown nobody /usr/local/var/odbcbridge
    # cp bridge/odbcbridge.conf /usr/local/etc
    # cp bridge/odbclogins /usr/local/etc
    # chmod 0600 /usr/local/etc/odbclogins
    # chown nobody /usr/local/etc/odbclogins
    # mkdir /usr/local/etc/init.d
    # cp bridge/unixodbc /usr/local/etc/init.d
    # cp bridge/odbcbridge /usr/local/sbin
    # chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/odbcbridge

  If everything is installed correctly, you should be able
  to start and stop the server by typing:

    # /usr/local/etc/init.d/unixodbc start
    # /usr/local/etc/init.d/unixodbc stop

  To start the server when the system starts, install the unixodbc 
  script in the same directory as the other local startup scripts, 
  refer to the system administration documents for information 
  about how to start daemons during system initialization.


- Installing the GUI data manager, tkdm

  The GUI data manager, tkdm is installed when UnixODBC.pm is 
  installed.  Refer to the man page ("man tkdm") and the 
  tkdm/README file for instructions about configuring tkdm.


- Installing the Web data manager

  The Web data manager works with the Web servers: Apache 1.3 and 
  2.0, and the Web browsers: Mozilla 1.0, Netscape 4.75, and Internet 
  Explorer 3.03.

  The document describes a configuration that uses 
  /usr/local/apache/htdocs as the Apache DocumentRoot directory and 
  /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin as the CGI script directory.  Make the 
  necessary adjustments for the system's Apache configuration.

  APACHE CONFIGURATION - Httpd.conf must be configured to load mod_perl, 
  mod_env, and mod_ssi, and use server-side includes. On some systems, 
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the server's environment must be able to locate all 
  of the libraries that the DBMS server, ODBC, and Perl require.

  The data manager is configured to be installed in the, "datamanager,"
  subdirectory of, "htdocs,"  or the directory named in the httpd.conf
  DocumentRoot directive.  If installing in a different subdirectory, 
  modify the directives shown below for httpd.conf accordingly, and 
  change the value of $folder in the CGI script, datamanager.cgi.  

  If the Apache server does not have server-side includes enabled,
  add the following lines to httpd.conf:

    <Directory "/usr/local/apache/htdocs/datamanager">
        Options FollowSymLinks Includes
    </Directory>
    AddType text/html .shtml
    AddHandler server-parsed .shtml

  To add the path for all of the libraries to the server's 
  environment, add a line like this to httpd.conf:

    SetEnv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql

  The names of the directories will vary depending on the system's
  Apache and DBMS server configuration.

  Then restart the Apache:

  # /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl restart

  Then install the files with these steps.

  $ su
  # mkdir /usr/local/apache/htdocs/datamanager
  # cp datamanager/*.html /usr/local/apache/htdocs/datamanager
  # cp datamanager/*.shtml /usr/local/apache/htdocs/datamanager
  # cp datamanager/*.gif /usr/local/apache/icons
  # cp datamanger/odbclogins /usr/local/etc
  # cp datamanager/*.cgi /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin
  # cd /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin
  # chmod +x tables.cgi datamanager.cgi odbclogin.cgi

	Edit the path to the perl interpreter on the 
	first line of tables,cgi, datamanager.cgi, 
	odbclogin.cgi to the path of the actual perl 
	interpreter.  The path should be either 
	/usr/local/bin/perl, /usr/bin/perl, or the output 
	of the shell command, "which perl."

  # cd /usr/local/etc
  # chmod 0600 odbclogins
  # chown nobody odbclogins     # Use the UID/GID of httpd.conf's,
  # chgrp nobody odbclogins     # "User," and, "Group," directives.

  Edit each line of the file /usr/local/etc/odbclogins for
  the login of each system that has a bridge server installed.
  The format of each line is:

    host::user::password

  The user names and passwords need not be the same as those
  used to log in to the DSNs.  They simply need to allow the
  clients (either the CGI scripts or the command-line scripts)
  to log in to the bridge server on the remote system, so they
  need to be actual users with passwords, with their own
  entries in /etc/passwd.  

  IMPORTANT - /usr/local/etc/odbclogins contains login data 
  for remote systems.  It is important to change the permissions 
  and ownership so that it can be read by the httpd server 
  processes ONLY (i.e., the CGI scripts).  Apache servers often run 
  as user nobody, group nobody, but the ownership of 
  /usr/local/etc/odbclogins to the values in the User and Group 
  http.conf directives.

  Also, do a, "chmod 0600 /usr/local/etc/odbclogins," to remove,
  "group," and, "other," permissions from the file.  If this isn't 
  secure enough, you can also create a separate UID (www, for 
  example) and make sure to change the User directive value in 
  httpd.conf.

  Standard Disclaimer (Again) - The CGI scripts are written to
  find Perl as /usr/local/bin/perl.  If that isn't the
  configuration on the system, then either edit the first line
  of the scripts to reflect the actual location of the perl
  binary (the output of, "which perl") or make /usr/local/bin/perl 
  symlink to the interpreter.

  The ODBC logo is modified from the XPM in the unixODBC-2.2.2 
  Data Manager source tree.  

  CGI script errors are recorded in the Apache error_log, even if
  they don't appear in the browser window.  If the scripts seem
  to work right, but the data manager can't connect to data sources, 
  look for the bridge error messages in the syslog, and consult the
  section, "Troubleshooting," below.
  

- Client scripts

  The eg/ directory contains example ODBC clients for
  locally hosted ODBC servers.  The scripts that log into a
  data source require the DSN, DBMS login name and DBMS
  password as command line arguments.  The client scripts in
  the bridge/ subdirectory, for networked ODBC servers,
  additionally require the name or IP address of the host
  system. 

  Documentation for the client scripts are in the man pages.
  The command line option, "--help," prints a brief help
  message.

    # alltypes --help

    Clients for local host ODBC queries.

      - alltypes       List the SQL data types for a DSN.
      - apifuncs       ODBC API functions that a driver implements.
      - colattributes  Column attributes for a title.
      - connectinfo    Connection attributes.
      - datasources    DSN's on the local system.
      - driverinfo     Drivers on the local system.
      - rssoutput      Output result set as RSS RDF file.

    Clients for remote DSN queries are in the, "bridge,"
    subdirectory. 

      sampleclient and sampleclient2 - Testing ODBC function
      calls using the peer to peer bridge.

      - remotedsn      List the DSN's of a remote system.  
      - remotetables   List the tables of a remote DSN.

- Troubleshooting

  - Perl error messages similar to,

      <programname>: not found

    indicate that the script cannot locate the Perl
    interpreter.  Most of the scripts in UnixODBC.om (including
    CGI scripts) assume that the Perl binary is
    /usr/local/bin/perl.  If it isn't, you can make a symlink
    from the actual Perl interpreter, or edit the first line in
    the scripts to the path of the Perl binary.

  - If a program seems to take forever to start, it generally
    indicates that the Bridge server can't make a connection
    to another machine on a network, and usually indicates that
    a network system is not accessible.

  - "Failed to make first connection...," to a DSN generally
    means that either the remote bridge server is not running,
    the client was not able to log in, or the perl and library 
    versions of the systems are different.  Check the installation
    and configuration of the bridge server (above and, "man 
    odbcbrigde"), and make sure that you can make a connection to 
    the remote DSN with a text-mode client like remotedsn ("man
    remotedsn") or remotetables ("man remotetables").

    If the data manager can connect to local data sources but not
    remote data sources, the problem is likely in the RPC network
    layer.  Ensure that the versions of Perl, Net::Daemon,
    Storable, and RPC::PlServer are the same on local and
    remote systems.  Try connecting with one of the text mode
    clients (remotedsn, remotetables) to help diagnose the problem.

    The servers at all levels (DBMS server, HTTP server, bridge
    server) perform caching on the local and remote machines.  It
    might be necessary to restart both systems, especially if you
    change the configuration of one or more systems, or upgrade
    the software.  If you started the bridge server in the
    background, remember to re-start it if you change the system
    configuration.

  - If you receive, "Unexpected EOF while waiting for server
    reply," errors while logging into a DSN, try restarting the
    bridge server from a terminal session.

  - "Out of memory during large request," and "Maximum
    message size exceeded," errors occur when the size of a
    result set is greater than 64 kb.  This is because the
    bridge server uses integers as packet indexes.  Try to
    narrow the SQL query to produce a smaller result set.

  - Error and/or status messages do not show up in the
    system logs.  The clients, especially the Web data manager,
    can record activity by the UnixODBC bridge server, the ODBC
    Driver Manager, and the HTTP server in up to three (that's
    right, three) different system logs.

    1. UnixODBC bridge servers and clients use the syslog,
    "daemon," facility to record activity.  If daemon logging is
    not enabled (i.e., there is no, "daemon.log," file), typically
    add a line like this to /etc/syslogd.conf, for example (on
    Linux systems):


      daemon.*                              /var/log/daemon.log

    Refer to the man pages for syslogd, syslogd.conf, and/or
    syslog.conf depending on the Unix version.  If the 'debug' option 
    in /usr/local/etc/odbcbridge.conf is non-zero the ODBC server 
    generates additional status and error messages.  Remember to 
    restart the syslog daemon after making configuration changes.

    2. The functions dm_log_open(<logfilename>) and dm_log_close() 
    in UnixODBC.pm and UnixODBC::BridgeServer.pm begin and end the 
    logging of the ODBC run-time library.

    3. The HTTP server records HTTP and CGI script errors server's 
    error log.
